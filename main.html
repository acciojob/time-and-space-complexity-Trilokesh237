	<h1> Time and Space, Complexity </h1>
	<p> Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the size of the input. It's a key concept in computer science for evaluating how efficient an algorithm is. An algorithm is considered efficient if its time complexity grows slowly as the input size increases. Lower time complexity, such as O(1) or O(log n), generally indicates better performance, while higher complexities like O(n^2) or O(2^n) can lead to slower execution for larger inputs. Efficient algorithms are crucial for handling large datasets or performing computations in a reasonable time.</p>
	<p><b> Space Complexity </b> refers to the amount of memory required by an algorithm as a function of the size of the input. It evaluates how much extra space or memory the algorithm needs to run, in addition to the space needed for input data. When we say an algorithm has a space complexity of O(n), it means that the memory required grows linearly with the size of the input. For example, if the input size doubles, the space required also doubles. </p>
